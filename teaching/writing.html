    <p>We use IDE'S[Integrated Development Environments] to write code, it is a place to write run and debug code and also convert it to machine code.</p>
     <p>IDE's are like any other program on your computer except its used for the facilitation of code. eg(Netbeans, Visual studios</p>
    <p>An IDE allows the facilitation of code by computer, IDE's provide a graphic interface on your computer in which the proogrammer can easily write, run and debug code without having to worry about problems with complications or interpretation of the program, IDE's are able to turn your code into machine code and run it through the computer to produce results.</p>   
    <h3>IDE's also incude;</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Built in error checking for when code doesn't go right.</li>
        <li>Autofill for frequently used words</li>
        <li>Project hierachy</li>
