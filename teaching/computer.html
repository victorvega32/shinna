<h1 style="text-align: center;">WHAT CAN COMPUTERS DO</h1>
<p>Most programming language has an additional operator known as modulus, modulus allows us to get the reminder of a divisionlal operation.
    eg When you take 10 modulus 3 you are telling the computer to divide 10 by 3, ignore the answer and give us the remainder 1.
