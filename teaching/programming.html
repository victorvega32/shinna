<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>MEANING OF PROGRAMMING</strong></h1>
<P>Programming can be defined as attempting to get a computer to complete a specific task without making mistakes.</P>
<p>Programming is a specific set of rules given to a computer in order to do a task right.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Machine code</h2>
<p>Machine code is the only language the computer can understand, it is known as binary. A series of 1's and 0's.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Programming Languages</h2>
<p>This is a tool used to translate our instructions into machine code[middle man].</p>

<ul>
    <li>Each programming language has its own unique uses <ul>
        <li>java and python: general level languages.</li>
        <li> html/css: designed for specific uses</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Each language also varies in how powerful it is <ul>
        <li>javascript isn't used for big problems.</li>
        <li>java and python are</li>
    </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Each language also has an attribute known as power or level. <ul>
            <li>low level programming languages <ul>
                <li>assembly or c</li>
            </ul>
            <li>high level programming languages <ul> <li>java or python</li></ul> </li>
            
        </ul>
</ul>

    <p>NOTE: The lower the level of your programming language the more your code will resemble what the machine can interprete as instruction{machine code}</p>
