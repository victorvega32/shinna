        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Uses of console</h2>
        <p>The main use of the console is to output text from the program using code, more specifically a print statement.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Print statement</h3>
        <p>The print statement is a command that prints texts to the console for the programmers viewing pleasure, the print statement will vary depending on the language you are using. <br>Its for viewing and interpreting the computer's output from a program, the console is mainly a developer's tool and interacted with by the end user except in very abstract cases.
